            <h2>Eminem</h2>
            <p>Listen to his music for just a minute or two and you’ll have one question in your head: is Eminem the fastest rapper? The artist is impressive when it comes to his word per minute abilities, but does this mean that he’s at the top? While he’s
                definitely one of the fastest rappers, Eminem doesn’t hold the number one spot. The Guiness Book of World Records has listed Chicago MC Twista as the World’s Fastest Rapper. However, this is a complicated question and Eminem may in fact
                be the fastest rapper in the world.</p>
